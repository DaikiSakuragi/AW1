        <p>Come to decide that the things that I tried
            Were in my life just to get high on
            When I sit alone
            Come get a little known
            But I need more than myself this time
            Step from the road to the sea to the sky
            And I do believe that we rely on
            When I lay it on
            Come get to play it on
            All my life to sacrifice
            Hey oh
            Listen what I say, oh
            I got your hey oh
            Now listen what I say, oh</p>
